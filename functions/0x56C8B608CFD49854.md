# HUD::THEFEED_AUTO_POST_GAMETIPS_ON

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Turns random game tips on.
THEFEED_FORCE_RENDER_ON() may need to be called depending on
where this needs to be displayed.

Enables loading screen tips to be be shown (`THEFEED_SHOW`), blocks other kinds of notifications from being displayed (at least from current script). Call `THEFEED_AUTO_POST_GAMETIPS_OFF` to display those again.
