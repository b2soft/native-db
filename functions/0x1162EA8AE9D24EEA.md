# MISC::OVERRIDE_SAVE_HOUSE

## Summary
Call this with bOverride=TRUE to force the player to respawn at vecCoords with fHeading instead of at a savehouse after a load.
These settings will be applied to all saves until you call the command again with bOverride=FALSE

## Parameters
* **BOOL** override
* **FLOAT** vecCoordsX
* **FLOAT** vecCoordsY
* **FLOAT** vecCoordsZ
* **FLOAT** heading
* **BOOL** isAnAutosave:
Some savehouses are flagged by SET_SAVE_HOUSE as not being available for autosaves.
Pass TRUE for this parameter to ignore those savehouses when finding the closest one.
* **VECTOR\*** vecReturnCoords
* **FLOAT\*** outHeading

## Returns
* **BOOL**:
If you've called the command with bOverride=TRUE then vecReturnCoords and fReturnHeading should just be the same settings you've passed in.
If you've called the command with bOverride=FALSE then vecReturnCoords and fReturnHeading will be the coordinates and heading for the closest open savehouse for the current player character.
Should always return TRUE if you've called the command with bOverride=TRUE.
Otherwise, it'll return TRUE if a valid savehouse was found for the current player character.
