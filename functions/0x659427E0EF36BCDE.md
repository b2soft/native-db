# TASK::TASK_VEHICLE_MISSION

## Summary
Tells a ped to perform a task when in a vehicle against another vehicle.

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** pedIndex
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** vehicleIndex
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** targetVehicleIndex
* **VEHICLE_MISSION** mission
* **FLOAT** cruiseSpeed
* **DRIVINGMODE** mode
* **FLOAT** targetReachedDist
* **FLOAT** straightLineDist:
(the distance at which the ai switches to heading for the target directly instead of following the nodes) (just like in sa) Use TASK_VEHICLE_MISSION_PED_TARGET to target another ped instead of a vehicle.
The task status is the same as that for TASK_VEHICLE_MISSION, i.e.
use GET_SCRIPT_TASK_STATUS(a_ped, SCRIPT_TASK_CAR_MISSION, my_status) to check for both commands.
To pick default values (recommended) both parameters can be passed in as -1.
* **BOOL** driveAgainstTraffic = true: Being true allows the car to drive on the opposite side of the road into incoming traffic
