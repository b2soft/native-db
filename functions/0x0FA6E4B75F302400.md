## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Tells a vehicle to escort another entity.

Makes a ped follow the targetVehicle with <minDistance> in between.

note: minDistance is ignored if drivingstyle is avoiding traffic, but Rushed is fine.

Mode: The mode defines the relative position to the targetVehicle. The ped will try to position its vehicle there.
-1 = behind
0 = ahead
1 = left
2 = right
3 = back left
4 = back right

if the target is closer than noRoadsDistance, the driver will ignore pathing/roads and follow you directly.
