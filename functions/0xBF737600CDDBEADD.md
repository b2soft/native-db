More Info

## Parameters
* **STRUCT\*** structToSave
* **INT** sizeOfStruct
* **STRING** nameOfStructInstance

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Tells the game that all REGISTER_..._TO_SAVE commands up to the matching STOP_SAVE_STRUCT are within an instance
of this STRUCT. The game can save a bit of memory if you write a procedure to register each struct e.g.
PROC RegisterMyStruct(MyStruct &TestMyStruct, STRING NameOfInstanceOfMyStruct)
START_SAVE_STRUCT(TestMyStruct, NameOfInstanceOfMyStruct)
REGISTER_INT_TO_SAVE(TestMyStruct.IntWithinMyStruct, "IntWithinMyStruct")
STOP_SAVE_STRUCT()
ENDPROC
You can then call your procedure to register each instance of your STRUCT.
You can save STRUCTs within STRUCTs.
