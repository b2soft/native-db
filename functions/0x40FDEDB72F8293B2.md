# ENTITY::FORCE_ENTITY_AI_AND_ANIMATION_UPDATE

## Parameters
* **ENTITY_INDEX** entityIndex

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Forces the entities ai and animation to be processed again this frame. This command is expensive and must be used sparingly!
Its primary purpose is to update entity animations immediately on the first frame of a scripted cut scene (where a camera cut is being used).

Based on carmod_shop script decompile this takes a vehicle parameter. It is called when repair is done on initial enter.
