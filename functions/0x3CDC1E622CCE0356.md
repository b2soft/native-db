# AUDIO::OVERRIDE_VEH_HORN

## Summary
Overrides the current vehicle horn

## Parameters
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** vehIndex
* **BOOL** override
* **INT** overridenHornHash

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Overrides the vehicle's horn hash.
When changing this hash on a vehicle, it will not return the 'overwritten' hash. It will still always return the default horn hash (same as GET_VEHICLE_DEFAULT_HORN)

vehicle - the vehicle whose horn should be overwritten
mute - p1 seems to be an option for muting the horn
p2 - maybe a horn id, since the function AUDIO::GET_VEHICLE_DEFAULT_HORN(veh) exists?
