# GRAPHICS::START_NETWORKED_PARTICLE_FX_NON_LOOPED_ON_ENTITY

## Summary
Trigger a set piece (non looped) particle effect on an entity with an offset position and orientation.

## Parameters
* **STRING** fxName: The name of the particle effect to be triggered
* **ENTITY_INDEX** entityIndex: The index of the entity to attach the particle effect to VECTOR position - the offset position to play the particle effect at VECTOR rotation - the offset rotation of the particle effect
* **FLOAT** vecPositionX
* **FLOAT** vecPositionY
* **FLOAT** vecPositionZ
* **FLOAT** vecRotationX
* **FLOAT** vecRotationY
* **FLOAT** vecRotationZ
* **FLOAT** scale = 1: Size scale of the effect (default size = 1.0)
* **BOOL** invertAxisX = false
* **BOOL** invertAxisY = false
* **BOOL** invertAxisZ = false

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Triggers a named particle effect on an entity at an offset position, that will replicate across the network.
This should only be used with non-looped particle effects.
The particle effect will then play and tidy itself up when finished.
There is no access to the particle effect once it has been triggered.
