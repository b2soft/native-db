# PATHFIND::GET_SAFE_COORD_FOR_PED

## Parameters
* **FLOAT** coorsX
* **FLOAT** coorsY
* **FLOAT** coorsZ
* **BOOL** onlyOnPavement
* **VECTOR\*** outSafeCoors
* **GET_SAFE_COORD_FLAGS** flags = 0

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Checks to see if it can find a safe bit of ground to place a ped.
This command has been extended to provide a set of bitflags to give more control over how it searches for positions.
(The old bOnlyOnPavement parameter still works but you should start using the GSC_FLAG_ONLY_PAVEMENT instead as it will be removed eventually.)
Use this carefully since it can have a considerable performance hit, having to stall the game whilst it queries navmesh polygons

Flags are:
1 = 1 = B02_IsFootpath
2 = 4 = !B15_InteractionUnk
4 = 0x20 = !B14_IsInterior
8 = 0x40 = !B07_IsWater
16 = 0x200 = B17_IsFlatGround
When onGround == true outPosition is a position located on the nearest pavement.

When a safe coord could not be found the result of a function is false and outPosition == Vector3.Zero.

In the scripts these flags are used: 0, 14, 12, 16, 20, 21, 28. 0 is most commonly used, then 16. 

16 works for me, 0 crashed the script.
