## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Checks if an entity's IS_VISIBLE flag is set, i.e. whether it's being explicitly hidden (by code or script) or not.
Note that this function returns true for all entities that have their IS_VISIBLE flag set,
even those that aren't actually visible from the current camera (i.e. they are outside
the view frustum or behind occluders).
