# NETWORK::GET_NETWORK_TIME_ACCURATE

## Returns
* **TIME_DATATYPE**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Returns the network time. This will return the time *now*

Returns the same value as GET_NETWORK_TIME in freemode, but as opposed to `GET_NETWORK_TIME` it always gets the most recent time, instead of once per tick.
Could be used for benchmarking since it can return times in ticks.
