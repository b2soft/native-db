## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
PAUSE_MENU_ACTIVATE_CONTEXT( HASH("ThisContext") ), can later be queried by PauseMenu.XML or script

Activates the specified frontend menu context.
pausemenu.xml defines some specific menu options using 'context'. Context is basically a 'condition'. 
The `*ALL*` part of the context means that whatever is being defined, will be active when any or all of those conditions after `*ALL*` are met.
The `*NONE*` part of the context section means that whatever is being defined, will NOT be active if any or all of the conditions after `*NONE*` are met.
This basically allows you to hide certain menu sections, or things like instructional buttons.
