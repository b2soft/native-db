# HUD::UPDATE_RADAR_ZOOM_TO_BLIP

## Summary
Zooms in/out enough so that the passed blip is on the edge of the minimap

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Must be called sparingly as it re-inits the range check for a blip.  Call this if you are zoomed to a blip and the blip has moved and you want the minimap to re-zoom to it

Does nothing (it's a nullsub).
