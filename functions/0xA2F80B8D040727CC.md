Locks the doors for all players. Only used in the network game.

After some analysis, I've decided that these are what the parameters are.

We can see this being used in R* scripts such as "am_mp_property_int.ysc.c4":
l_11A1 = PED::GET_VEHICLE_PED_IS_IN(PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID(), 1);
...
VEHICLE::SET_VEHICLE_DOORS_LOCKED_FOR_ALL_PLAYERS(l_11A1, 1);
