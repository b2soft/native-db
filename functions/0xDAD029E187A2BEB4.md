# TASK::TASK_HELI_MISSION

## Summary
Gives the heli a mission.

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** pedIndex
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** heliIndex
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** targetVehicleIndex: (If a target vehicle needs to be specified it is done here)
* **PED_INDEX** targetPedIndex: (If a target ped needs to be specified it is done here) FLOAT TargetX, TargetY, TargetZ (specify targetcoordinates here in needed.)
* **FLOAT** coorsX
* **FLOAT** coorsY
* **FLOAT** coorsZ
* **VEHICLE_MISSION** mission
* **FLOAT** cruiseSpeed: (in m/s)
* **FLOAT** targetReachedDist: (distance (in meters) at which heli thinks it's arrived.) ALSO used as the hover distance for MISSION_ATTACK and MISSION_CIRCLE
* **FLOAT** heliOrientation:
(orientation heli tries to be in.
(0-360) Use -1 if not bothered.
-1 Should be used in 99% of the times)
* **INT** flightHeight:
(z coordinate the heli tries to maintain.
ie 30 == 30 meters above sea level)
* **INT** minHeightAboveTerrain:
(height in meters that the heli will try to stay above terrain.
ie 20 == always tries to stay at least 20 meters above ground.) FLOAT fSlowDownDistance.
 setting to -1 means use default tuning(100).
 in general get more control with big number and more dynamic with smaller #
* **FLOAT** slowDownDistance = -1
* **HELIMODE** heliFlags = 0

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Must have targetVehicle, targetPed, OR destination X/Y/Z set
Will follow targeted vehicle/ped, or fly to destination
Set whichever is not being used to 0


Mission mode type:
 - 4, 7: Forces heli to snap to the heading if set, flies to destination or tracks specified entity (mode 4 only works for coordinates, 7 works for coordinates OR ped/vehicle)
 - 6: Attacks the target ped/vehicle with mounted weapons. If radius is set, will maintain that distance from target.
 - 8: Makes the heli flee from the ped/vehicle/coordinate
 - 9: Circles around target ped/vehicle, snaps to angle if set. Behavior flag (last parameter) of 2048 switches from counter-clockwise to clockwise circling. Does not work with coordinate destination.
 - 10, 11: Follows ped/vehicle target and imitates target heading. Only works with ped/vehicle target, not coord target
 - 19: Heli lands at specified coordinate, ignores heading (lands facing whatever direction it is facing when the task is started)
 - 20: Makes the heli land when near target ped. It won't resume chasing.
 - 21: Emulates a helicopter crash
 - 23: makes the heli circle erratically around ped


Heli will fly at maxSpeed (up to actual maximum speed defined by the model's handling config)
You can use SET_DRIVE_TASK_CRUISE_SPEED to modulate the speed based on distance to the target without having to re-invoke the task native. Setting to 8.0 when close to the destination results in a much smoother approach.

If minHeight and maxHeight are set, heli will fly between those specified elevations, relative to ground level and any obstructions/buildings below. You can specify -1 for either if you only want to specify one. Usually it is easiest to leave maxHeight at -1, and specify a reasonable minHeight to ensure clearance over any obstacles. Note this MUST be passed as an INT, not a FLOAT. 

Radius affects how closely the heli will follow tracked ped/vehicle, and when circling (mission type 9) sets the radius (in meters) that it will circle the target from

Heading is -1.0 for default behavior, which will point the nose of the helicopter towards the destination. Set a heading and the heli will lock to that direction when near its destination/target, but may still turn towards the destination when flying at higher speed from a further distance.

Behavior Flags is a bitwise value that modifies the AI behavior. Not clear what all flags do, but here are some guesses/notes:
   1: Forces heading to face E
   2: Unknown
   4: Tight circles around coordinate destination
   8: Unknown
  16: Circles around coordinate destination facing towards destination
  32: Flys to normally, then lands at coordinate destination and stays on the ground (using mission type 4)
  64: Ignores obstacles when flying, will follow at specified minHeight above ground level but will not avoid buildings, vehicles, etc.
 128: Unknown
 256: Unknown
 512: Unknown
1024: Unknown 
2048: Reverses direction of circling (mission type 9) to clockwise
4096: Hugs closer to the ground, maintains minHeight from ground generally, but barely clears buildings and dips down more between buildings instead of taking a more efficient/safe route
8192: Unknown

Unk3 is a float value, you may see -1082130432 for this value in decompiled native scripts, this is the equivalent to -1.0f. Seems to affect acceleration/aggressiveness, but not sure exactly how it works. Higher value seems to result in lower acceleration/less aggressive flying. Almost always -1.0 in native scripts, occasionally 20.0 or 50.0. Setting to 400.0 seems to work well for making the pilot not overshoot the destination when using coordinate destination.
