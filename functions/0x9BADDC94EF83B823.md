# STREAMING::BEGIN_SRL

## Summary
Marks the beginning of a streaming request list. This can be called before playing back a scripted cutscene.
If recording is enabled in RAG, the system will record all visible assets and save them to a file once the
SRL is done (after the call to END_SRL).
If recording is disabled (which is normally the case), the recorded assets from the SRL will be requested
as the scripted cutscene plays.
You must call PREFETCH_SRL before calling this function!
