Disables "wings" for some flying vehicles. Works only for oppressor _2_ and deluxo.
For deluxo it just immediately removes vehicle's "wings" and you will be not able to fly up.
For oppressor 2 it will remove wings right after you land. And you will not able to fly up anymore too.
But for opressor 2 you still can fly if you somehow get back in the air.
