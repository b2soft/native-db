## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Calculates the travel distance between a set of points.

Doesn't seem to correlate with distance on gps sometimes.
This function returns the value 100000.0 over long distances, seems to be a failure mode result, potentially occurring when not all path nodes are loaded into pathfind.
