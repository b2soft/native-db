# GRAPHICS::SET_SCRIPT_GFX_ALIGN_PARAMS

## Summary
Sets the additional alignment parameters
offsetX, offsetY : Value to offset all x,y coords passed to 2d renderer.
sizeX : If you are aligned to the right of the screen it assumes the x size of everything is this. This makes the calculations for
positioning multiple UI elements of different sizes easier. Set this to the size of the largest element
sizeY : If you are aligned to the bottom of the screen it assumes the y size of everything is this. As above set this to the size of
largest element

## Parameters
* **FLOAT** offsetX
* **FLOAT** offsetY
* **FLOAT** sizeX
* **FLOAT** sizeY

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Sets the draw offset/calculated size for SET_SCRIPT_GFX_ALIGN. If using any alignment other than left/top, the game expects the width/height to be configured using this native in order to get a proper starting position for the draw command.
