# TASK::SET_EXCLUSIVE_SCENARIO_GROUP

## Summary
Specify a particular group that should be the only scenario group that should be enabled
(scenarios that are not in any group will also be considered disabled). There can only be one
of these, using the command again will replace any previously set exclusive group. Note that
this command does not change the regular enabled/disabled state of the group, so you may
also need to enable your group with SET_SCENARIO_GROUP_ENABLED in order for it to work.

## Parameters
* **STRING** scenarioGroupName

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This now works like a reset flag and must be continually set every frame the scenario group ought
to be exlusive!
