# TASK::TASK_SEEK_COVER_TO_COORDS

## Summary
Tells a ped to seek cover to given coords VecCooverCoors in such a way as to hide from VecFromCoors.

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** pedIndex
* **FLOAT** cooverCoorsX
* **FLOAT** cooverCoorsY
* **FLOAT** cooverCoorsZ
* **FLOAT** fromCoorsX
* **FLOAT** fromCoorsY
* **FLOAT** fromCoorsZ
* **INT** time
* **BOOL** canPeekAndAim = false

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The ped will find the nearest cover point to the coords given.
Once cover is reached the ped will hide behind it for Time milliseconds then the task will end, if Time is zero the ped will hide behind it indefinitely and the task will never end.

p8 causes the ped to take the shortest route to the cover position. It may have something to do with navmesh or pathfinding mechanics.
