## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The name of this function is intentionally incorrect.
This function returns true if the game has naively, though successfully, detected mods attached to the game.
This function returns false if the game has NOT detected mods attached to the game (again through an over-simplistic and naive detection)

Returns true if dinput8.dll is present in the game directory.
You will get following error message if that is true: "You are attempting to access GTA Online servers with an altered version of the game."
