# CAM::ATTACH_CAM_TO_VEHICLE_BONE

## Summary
Attaches a camera to a vehicle's bone

## Parameters
* **CAMERA_INDEX** cameraIndex
* **ENTITY_INDEX** vehicleIndex: The index of the vehicle to attach the camera to.
* **INT** vehicleBoneIndex: The index of the vehicle bone to attach to.
* **BOOL** hardAttachment:
If set to true, will fully attach the camera to the bone transform, otherwise only the position of the bone will be retained.
vecRotationOffset: An additional rotational offset to be applied from the attach bone rotation (x=yaw, y=pitch, z=roll).
This is only considered if hardAttachment is set to TRUE.
vecPositionOffset: An additional offset to be applied from the attach position.
* **FLOAT** vecRotationOffsetX
* **FLOAT** vecRotationOffsetY
* **FLOAT** vecRotationOffsetZ
* **FLOAT** vecPositionOffsetX
* **FLOAT** vecPositionOffsetY
* **FLOAT** vecPositionOffsetZ
* **BOOL** offsetIsRelative: If true, the offsets are applied relative to the transform of the attached vehicle (not the bone), rather than in world-space.
