# PLAYER::SET_AIR_DRAG_MULTIPLIER_FOR_PLAYERS_VEHICLE

## Parameters
* **PLAYER_INDEX** playerIndex
* **FLOAT** dragMult

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Force higher air drag mult on any car or bike the player uses until the mission ends or this command is called again with 1.0, fDragMult range 1.0 - 15.0  (5.0 is standard for high air resistance zones on the map)

This can be between 1.0f - 14.9f 

You can change the max in IDA from 15.0. I say 15.0 as the function blrs if what you input is greater than or equal to 15.0 hence why it's 14.9 max default.
