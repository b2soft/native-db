# VEHICLE::SET_RENDER_TRAIN_AS_DERAILED

## Summary
Sets the train to look derailed.

## Parameters
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** trainIndex
* **BOOL** val

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
If this value is set to true the carriages will be rendered at a slight random angle. This will make it look like the train has derailed.
In every other way the train is a normal train and it can still move. The player can still get on it etc.

Makes the train all jumbled up and derailed as it moves on the tracks (though that wont stop it from its normal operations)
