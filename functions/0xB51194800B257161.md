<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
camName is always set to "DEFAULT_SCRIPTED_CAMERA" in Rockstar's scripts.
------------
Camera names found in the b617d scripts:
"DEFAULT_ANIMATED_CAMERA"
"DEFAULT_SCRIPTED_CAMERA"
"DEFAULT_SCRIPTED_FLY_CAMERA"
"DEFAULT_SPLINE_CAMERA"

Side Note: It seems p8 is basically to represent what would be the bool p1 within CREATE_CAM native. As well as the p9 since it's always 2 in scripts seems to represent what would be the last param within SET_CAM_ROT native which normally would be 2.
