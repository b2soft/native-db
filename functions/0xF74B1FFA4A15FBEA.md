# PATHFIND::SET_ALLOW_STREAM_HEIST_ISLAND_NODES

## Summary
Set to TRUE to allow heist island road nodes from being
loaded, FALSE to disable

## Parameters
* **BOOL** allow: Setting to true disables main level and prologue nodes from streaming, so need to set back to false

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Activates Cayo Perico path nodes if passed `1`. GPS navigation will start working, maybe more stuff will change, not sure. It seems if you try to unload (pass `0`) when close to the island, your game might crash.
