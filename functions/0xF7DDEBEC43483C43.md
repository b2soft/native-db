* **PTFX_ID** ptfxId: The id of the started particle effect to update VECTOR position - the new position of the particle effect VECTOR rotation - the offset rotation of the particle effect
* **FLOAT** positionX
* **FLOAT** positionY
* **FLOAT** positionZ
* **FLOAT** vecRotationX
* **FLOAT** vecRotationY
* **FLOAT** vecRotationZ

## Description
