# MISC::GET_DISTANCE_BETWEEN_COORDS

## Summary
Gets the distance between 2 coords

## Parameters
* **FLOAT** firstCoorsX
* **FLOAT** firstCoorsY
* **FLOAT** firstCoorsZ
* **FLOAT** secondCoorsX
* **FLOAT** secondCoorsY
* **FLOAT** secondCoorsZ
* **BOOL** check3d = true

## Returns
* **FLOAT**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
For 2d checks use only the x and y components of the vector as the z value is zeroed by the code.

Returns the distance between two three-dimensional points, optionally ignoring the Z values.
If useZ is false, only the 2D plane (X-Y) will be considered for calculating the distance.

Consider using this faster native instead: SYSTEM::VDIST - DVIST always takes in consideration the 3D coordinates.
