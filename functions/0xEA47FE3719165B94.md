# TASK::TASK_PLAY_ANIM

## Summary
Plays a anim task on a ped

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** pedIndex
* **STRING** animDictName
* **STRING** animName
* **FLOAT** blendInDelta = 8:
The rate at which the task will blend in The blend in duration is 1.0 / fBlendInDelta e.g.
1.0 / NORMAL_BLEND_IN -> 1.0 / 8.0 = 0.125 seconds
* **FLOAT** blendOutDelta = -8:
The rate at which the task will blend out The blend out duration is -1.0 / fBlendOutDelta e.g.
-1.0 / NORMAL_BLEND_OUT -> -1.0 / -8.0 = 0.125 seconds
* **INT** timeToPlay = -1
* **ANIMATION_FLAGS** animFlags = 0
* **FLOAT** startPhase = 0
* **BOOL** phaseControlled = false
* **IK_CONTROL_FLAGS** ikFlags = 0
* **BOOL** allowOverrideCloneUpdate = false:
Is used in MP and has this effect: On a locally controlled ped it will have the effect that the ped will not send a sync of the animation and will only run the animation locally.
is used on a clone ped, the ped will only run the animation locally and wont send a request to the owner to run the animation.
Therefore bAllowOverrideCloneUpdate allows independent animating on peds, local or clones, and it will require that the script ensures that no other networked animation is concurrently used or expected on the ped during any period of its use.

float speed > normal speed is 8.0f

float speedMultiplier > multiply the playback speed

int duration: time in millisecond
----------------------
-1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _> Default (see flag)
0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ > Not play at all
Small value _ _ > Slow down animation speed
Other _ _ _ _ _ > freeze player control until specific time (ms) has 
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ passed. (No effect if flag is set to be

int flag:

   ANIM_FLAG_CANCELABLE = 120,
};
Odd number : loop infinitely
Even number : Freeze at last frame
Multiple of 4: Freeze at last frame but controllable
