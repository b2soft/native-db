# MONEY::NETWORK_DELETE_CHARACTER

## Summary
Call to do a transaction to delete a character slot.

## Parameters
* **INT** character: Value for the current character 0 to 4.
* **BOOL** wipeWallet = true
* **BOOL** wipeBank = false

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Note the 2nd parameters are always 1, 0. I have a feeling it deals with your money, wallet, bank. So when you delete the character it of course wipes the wallet cash at that time. So if that was the case, it would be eg, NETWORK_DELETE_CHARACTER(characterIndex, deleteWalletCash, deleteBankCash);
