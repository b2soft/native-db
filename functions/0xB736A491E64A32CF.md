# ENTITY::SET_ENTITY_AS_NO_LONGER_NEEDED

## Summary
Sets the entity to be removed, cannot refer to entity from script

## Parameters
* **ENTITY_INDEX\*** entityIndex

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The entity will added back into the world population and deleted when off screen.

Marks the specified entity (ped, vehicle or object) as no longer needed if its population type is set to the mission type.
If the entity is ped, it will also clear their tasks immediately just like when CLEAR_PED_TASKS_IMMEDIATELY is called.
Entities marked as no longer needed, will be deleted as the engine sees fit.
Use this if you just want to just let the game delete the ped:
void MarkPedAsAmbientPed(Ped ped) {
  auto addr = getScriptHandleBaseAddress(ped);

  if (!addr) {
    return;
  }

  //the game uses only lower 4 bits as entity population type 
  BYTE origValue = *(BYTE *)(addr + 0xDA);
  *(BYTE *)(addr + 0xDA) = ((origValue & 0xF0) | ePopulationType::POPTYPE_RANDOM_AMBIENT);
}
