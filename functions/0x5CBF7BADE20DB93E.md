"sender" is the very top header. This can be any old string.
"subject" is the header under the sender.
"duration" is a multiplier, so 1.0 is normal, 2.0 is twice as long (very slow), and 0.5 is half as long.
"clanTag" shows a crew tag in the "sender" header, after the text. You need to use 3 underscores as padding. Maximum length of this field seems to be 7. (e.g. "MK" becomes "___MK", "ACE" becomes "___ACE", etc.)
