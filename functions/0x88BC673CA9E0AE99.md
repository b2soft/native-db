# VEHICLE::SET_VEHICLE_USE_MORE_RESTRICTIVE_SPAWN_CHECKS

## Summary
This is used for cases where a car might be driving on the wrong side of the road or avoiding cars
at a distance away from the player where other cars might be trying to spawn. It's somewhat expensive
so we don't do it for everybody

## Parameters
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** vehicleIndex
* **BOOL** useRestrictiveCheck

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Passing TRUE to this command will do some extra trajectory checks with this vehicle to prevent other vehicles
from spawning in its way
This is a reset flag and needs to be called each frame
