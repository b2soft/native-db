Unlike restricted vehicle ammo (which is code fired), this is script-fired and manually decremented, and only stored in vehicle code for network sync purposes.

## Parameters
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** vehicleIndex

## Returns
* **INT**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Gets the amount of bombs that this vehicle has. As far as I know, this does _not_ impact vehicle weapons or the ammo of those weapons in any way, it is just a way to keep track of the amount of bombs in a specific plane.
