# AUDIO::SET_VARIABLE_ON_STREAM

## Summary
Sets a variable on the current streaming sound.

## Parameters
* **STRING** variableName
* **FLOAT** variableValue

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This command allows a scripter to communicate with the sound engine in complex ways,
by passing a floating point value to a specific sound object. This allows some nice effects such as adjusting the pitch of a sample being to be played back,
or varying a lowpass cutoff. The VariableName parameter must be set up in RAVE (the audio scripting tool) as well as instruction on its usage on a case-by-case
basis therefore a sound designer must be consulted with before using this command.

From the scripts, p0:

"ArmWrestlingIntensity",
"INOUT",
"Monkey_Stream",
"ZoomLevel"
