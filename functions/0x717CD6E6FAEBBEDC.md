## Summary
This should only be called by the end credits script.

## Parameters
* **BOOL** allowPause

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The credits will call it with FALSE at the start and
TRUE at the end. This is to stop the scrolling of the credits from pausing when the player warps from
one area of the city to another during the screen fades.
