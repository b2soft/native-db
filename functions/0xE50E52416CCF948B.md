# PATHFIND::GET_NTH_CLOSEST_VEHICLE_NODE

## Summary
WIill return if can the nth ( n = 1 being closest) closest vehicle node, to a coord

## Parameters
* **FLOAT** coorsX
* **FLOAT** coorsY
* **FLOAT** coorsZ
* **INT** nodeNumber
* **VECTOR\*** outNearestNodeCoors
* **NODE_FLAGS** nodeFlags = 1
* **FLOAT** zMeasureMult = 3:
How strongly should the difference in Z direction be weighted? 0.0 = ignored completely, 1.0 = the same as 2d distance.
Default is 3.0 since we tend to care about height differences more than 2d distance.
* **FLOAT** zTolerance = 0: How far apart to the Z coords have to be before zMeasureMult kicks in?

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
VecCoors.Z will be calculated automatically if you give it a value of â€“100.0 or below. If NodeNumber is 1 then the closest node will be returned (as with the two commands above).
If NodeNumber is 2 then the second closest node will be returned and so on. The command will return FALSE if no node could be found (probably due to the nodes not being streamed in).
