# PED::CREATE_NM_MESSAGE

## Summary
Create a Natural motion message.

## Parameters
* **NM_START_PARAM** startParam
* **NM_STR** messageType

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The messages type are the ones in the enum list that end in _MSG. These are the message names, as opposed to the params, and are all multiples of 20 so we can identify them.

Creates a new NaturalMotion message.

startImmediately: If set to true, the character will perform the message the moment it receives it by GIVE_PED_NM_MESSAGE. If false, the Ped will get the message but won't perform it yet. While it's a boolean value, if negative, the message will not be initialized.
messageId: The ID of the NaturalMotion message.

If a message already exists, this function does nothing. A message exists until the point it has been successfully dispatched by GIVE_PED_NM_MESSAGE.
