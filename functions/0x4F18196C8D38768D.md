# NETWORK::CLOUD_CHECK_AVAILABILITY

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Use this to check if cloud is up
This just requests a small cloud file but is behind a function so that
we can swap out the functionality for something better if needed
CLOUD_GET_AVAILABILITY_CHECK_POSIX is the POSIX of when the check was last
run. Will be 0 if never called.
