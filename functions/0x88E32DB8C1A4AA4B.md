# TASK::SET_PED_PATH_CLIMB_COST_MODIFIER

## Summary
Sets a multiplier to the cost function which decides whether a ped should climb whilst navigating
Default value is 1.0 which means the ped behaves as normal
The lower the value, the more likely a ped is to use a climb.
At 0.5 the ped will be twice as likely to climb as usual
At 0.0 the ped will climb just as likely as walk, even for the smallest movements (so don't use a value this low!)
At 2.0 the ped will be half as likely to use a climb
Etc, etc..
Be sure to set this back to 1.0 after use, or peds will behave strangely even after the mission ends.
