# PATHFIND::ADD_NAVMESH_BLOCKING_OBJECT

## Parameters
* **FLOAT** positionX
* **FLOAT** positionY
* **FLOAT** positionZ
* **FLOAT** sizeXYZX
* **FLOAT** sizeXYZY
* **FLOAT** sizeXYZZ
* **FLOAT** heading: The rotation of the object in radians - use DEG_TO_RAD() to convert from degrees if necessary
* **BOOL** permanent = false: If the object will last outside the lifetime of the callig script (always set to FALSE except in very special cases!)
* **BLOCKING_OBJECT_FLAGS** flags = 7:
A set of flags from the BLOCKING_OBJECT_FLAGS enumation; can be used to block certain types of pathfinding only.
TIP : To help setting up blocking objects in the game, use the RAG helper: ("Navigation\Blocking Bounds")

## Returns
* **INT**:
The return value is an integer which should be stored, and used when calling "REMOVE_NAVMESH_BLOCKING_OBJECT"
A return value of -1 indicates an error, and that the blocking object could not be added.

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This function adds a blocking obstacle in the navmesh, which will prevent peds from pathfinding through it.
This command will assert if two objects are added at the same XYZ position, this is order to catch duplicates.
