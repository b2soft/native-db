## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Task to start a move network of the type passed
When bAllowOverrideCloneUpdate is used in MP the remotely cloned ped will not update in sync with commands sent locally
and it is expected that the remote machine will override the update of the clones task signals.
This version allows the network to be setup with initial parameters (clipsets, floats and bools).

Used only once in the scripts (am_mp_nightclub)
