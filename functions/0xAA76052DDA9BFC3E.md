## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Causes the "PED DENSITY" in the given axis-aligned box to be boosted/reduced by the provided amount.
This can be used to cause more or less peds to spawn in a given area, than is set in the navmesh.
It will not have any affect upon areas where the ped density is by deafult zero.
This command should be called every frame for as long as it is required.
Only one such region may be set per frame, an assert will fire if it is set more that once per frame.
