# GRAPHICS::LOAD_MISSION_CREATOR_PHOTO

Once GET_STATUS_OF_LOAD_MISSION_CREATOR_PHOTO has returned PHOTO_OPERATION_SUCCEEDED, you can save the photo to the cloud with a new name using SAVE_MISSION_CREATOR_PHOTO
Once you're finished with the photo, call FREE_MEMORY_FOR_MISSION_CREATOR_PHOTO

* **INT** fileID
* **INT** fileVersion
* **INT** language

## Returns
