## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The minimum/default is 500.0f. If you plan to make it bigger set it's position as well. Also this seems to need to be called in a loop as when you close the phone the scale is reset. If not in a loop you'd need to call it everytime before you re-open the phone.
