* **FLOAT** v
* **FLOAT** rotation: The angle (in degrees) for the rotation
* **FLOAT** scale: The scale factor applied to the damage (range is 0.0 to 1.0, based on the MinSize/MaxSize tuning paramters in peddamage.xml) forceFrame - Allows a spefic frame of damage to be chosen (or use -1 for the usual random frame selection)

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Applies  ped blood damage on a ped by specifying a specific zone, direct UV offsets, rotation, scale, and initial Age (for animation effects).
You can also force a specified frame to be used instead of a randomly chosen one.
you can use the widgets in  "Peds/Ped Damage/Test Blood by UV (Script Params)" to test u,v values for different zones, rotations, scales, etc
