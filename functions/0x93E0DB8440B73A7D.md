<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
. Every time this command is called 64 nodes are batched (so you won't get the same node twice in the first 64 calls)
Once the node has been returned and perhaps sent to a client the coordinates to spawn a car can be found using GET_SPAWN_COORDINATES_FOR_CAR_NODE
