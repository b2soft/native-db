# GRAPHICS::START_NETWORKED_PARTICLE_FX_NON_LOOPED_ON_PED_BONE

## Summary
Trigger a set piece (non looped) particle effect on a ped bone with an offset position and orientation.

## Parameters
* **STRING** fxName
* **PED_INDEX** pedIndex: The index of the ped to attach the particle effect to VECTOR position - the offset position to play the particle effect at VECTOR rotation - the offset rotation of the particle effect
* **FLOAT** vecPositionX
* **FLOAT** vecPositionY
* **FLOAT** vecPositionZ
* **FLOAT** vecRotationX
* **FLOAT** vecRotationY
* **FLOAT** vecRotationZ
* **PED_BONETAG** boneTag: The bone tag to attach the particle effect to
* **FLOAT** scale = 1: Size scale of the effect (default size = 1.0)
* **BOOL** invertAxisX = false
* **BOOL** invertAxisY = false
* **BOOL** invertAxisZ = false

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Triggers a named particle effect on a ped bone at an offset position and rotation, that will replicate across the network.
This should only be used with non-looped particle effects.
The particle effect will then play and tidy itself up when finished.
There is no access to the particle effect once it has been triggered.
