## Parameters
* **NETWORK_INDEX** networkId: Network ID of the object to change the blending mode
* **BOOL** useHighPrecision: Flag indicating whether to use high precision or standard network blending

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Sets whether to use high precision network blending for the specified network ID. Currently this can only be
called on objects (not vehicles and peds). High precision blending is useful for small objects that need to be kept
very tightly in sync for gameplay purposes (e.g. a golf ball in a golf mini-game)
