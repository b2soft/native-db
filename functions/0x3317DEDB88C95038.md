## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Cannot give ped tasks if dead or dying. I.e. if the ped is running CTaskDamageDeath.
Calling IS_PED_FATALLY_INJURED doesn't necessarily mean that CTaskDamageDeath has started yet

Seems to consistently return true if the ped is dead.

p1 is always passed 1 in the scripts.

I suggest to remove "OR_DYING" part, because it does not detect dying phase.

That's what the devs call it, cry about it.
