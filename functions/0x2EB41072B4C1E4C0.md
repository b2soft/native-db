## Parameters
* **FLOAT** searchCoordsX
* **FLOAT** searchCoordsY
* **FLOAT** searchCoordsZ
* **INT\*** hashName1
* **INT\*** hashName2

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The nearest one returns the string in hashName1. The second one only gets returned if it is within 40 meters of the searchCoords. So hashName2 may be empty(0).

Determines the name of the street which is the closest to the given coordinates.

x,y,z - the coordinates of the street
streetName - returns a hash to the name of the street the coords are on
crossingRoad - if the coordinates are on an intersection, a hash to the name of the crossing road

Note: the names are returned as hashes, the strings can be returned using the function HUD::GET_STREET_NAME_FROM_HASH_KEY.
