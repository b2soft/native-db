## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This is intended as a replacement for the old commands for disabling visibility and collisions for an entity.
Improvements include support for objects, and support for automatic persistence across dummy conversion, map data streaming etc.
Creates an active model hide for a building or object

Same as the comment for CREATE_MODEL_SWAP unless for some reason p5 affects it this only works with objects as well.
