# TASK::TASK_GET_OFF_BOAT

## Summary
Tells a ped to get off a boat

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** pedIndex
* **INT** timer = 20000

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
There is no need to specify a boat, as the task itself will figure out which boat is underneath the ped.
This task does a number of linetests and is thus pretty expensive, so use with care (ie. not repeatedly!)
This task is automatically given to group peds, if they are on a boat but their leader is not.
