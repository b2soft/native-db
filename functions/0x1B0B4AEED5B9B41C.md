## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Sets the desired scaling to be applied to the side offset of the third-person cell phone camera, in selfie mode only. This offset is damped prior to being applied.
This allows the selfie framing to be customised and for cropping to be minimised.
