# GRAPHICS::TERRAINGRID_SET_PARAMS

## Summary
Sets all the parameters needed to render a grid

## Parameters
* **FLOAT** centrePosX
* **FLOAT** centrePosY
* **FLOAT** centrePosZ
* **FLOAT** dirX
* **FLOAT** dirY
* **FLOAT** dirZ
* **FLOAT** boxWidth: , boxHeight and boxDepth define the dimensions of the projection box (a depth of 1 should be enough in most cases)
* **FLOAT** boxHeight
* **FLOAT** boxDepth
* **FLOAT** gridRes: Determines the size of each cell within the grid
* **FLOAT** colMult: Is a multiplier applied to the final colour to make grid brighter or more subtle
* **FLOAT** minHeight: And maxHeight are the minimum and maximum heights used for the elevation colouring Note that most, if not all of these params should have been gathered via the RAG > Terrain Grid	widget
* **FLOAT** maxHeight

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This native is used along with these two natives: `TERRAINGRID_ACTIVATE` and `TERRAINGRID_SET_COLOURS`.
This native configures the location, size, rotation, normal height, and the difference ratio between min, normal and max.

All those natives combined they will output something like this: https://i.imgur.com/TC6cku6.png

This native renders a box at the given position, with a special shader that renders a grid on world geometry behind it. This box does not have backface culling.
The forward args here are a direction vector, something similar to what's returned by GET_ENTITY_FORWARD_VECTOR.
normalHeight and heightDiff are used for positioning the color gradient of the grid, colors specified via TERRAINGRID_SET_COLOURS.
