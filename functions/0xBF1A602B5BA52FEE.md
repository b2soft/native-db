## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This means that cars will drive on to these roads and new cars will be generated on them.
When a road is switched off, no cars should be created on it and cars that already exist will try to avoid driving on to it.
To undo a SWITCH_ROADS_ON or a SWITCH_ROADS_OFF, use SWITCH_ROADS_BACK_TO_ORIGINAL.

When nodeEnabled is set to false, all nodes in the area get disabled.
`GET_VEHICLE_NODE_IS_SWITCHED_OFF` returns true afterwards.
If it's true, `GET_VEHICLE_NODE_IS_SWITCHED_OFF` returns false.
