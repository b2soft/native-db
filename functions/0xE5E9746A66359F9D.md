# SAVEMIGRATION::SAVEMIGRATION_MP_REQUEST_STATUS

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Request the status of the users save migration.
Should be called by the game client before entering into multiplayer, on both gen8 and gen9 consoles,
so that a user doesn't enter into MP while a transfer is in progress for them, as this would cause them
to stomp on the changes being made, potentially corrupting the account.
