# VEHICLE::SET_DISABLE_MAP_COLLISION

## Summary
Disables map collision on the vehicle

## Parameters
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** vehicleIndex

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Disables collision for this vehicle (maybe it also supports other entities, not sure).
Only world/building/fixed world objects will have their collisions disabled, props, peds, or any other entity still collides with the vehicle.

Not sure if there is a native (and if so, which one) that resets the collisions.
