# PATHFIND::GET_NTH_CLOSEST_VEHICLE_NODE_FAVOUR_DIRECTION

## Summary
WIill return if can the closest vehicle node,tries to return a heading which points the car in the right direction to reach FaceCoors.

## Parameters
* **FLOAT** coorsX
* **FLOAT** coorsY
* **FLOAT** coorsZ
* **FLOAT** faceCoorsX
* **FLOAT** faceCoorsY
* **FLOAT** faceCoorsZ
* **INT** nodeNumber
* **VECTOR\*** outNearestNodeCoors
* **FLOAT\*** outHeading
* **NODE_FLAGS** nodeFlags = 1
* **FLOAT** zMeasureMult = 3:
How strongly should the difference in Z direction be weighted? 0.0 = ignored completely, 1.0 = the same as 2d distance.
Default is 3.0 since we tend to care about height differences more than 2d distance.
* **FLOAT** zTolerance = 0: How far apart to the Z coords have to be before zMeasureMult kicks in?

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
It will always obey one-way streets. If you want your car to go against one-way streets, you have to check to see if it's facing the right direction and rotate the car 180 degrees.

See gtaforums.com/topic/843561-pathfind-node-types for node type info. 0 = paved road only, 1 = any road, 3 = water

p10 always equals 3.0
p11 always equals 0
