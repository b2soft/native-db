# MISC::IGNORE_NEXT_RESTART

## Summary
Use in conjunction with PAUSE_DEATH_ARREST_RESTART. If the player is killed or arrested and chooses to replay the mission then call
IGNORE_NEXT_RESTART(TRUE) so that he isn't respawned at a hospital or police station.
IGNORE_NEXT_RESTART(TRUE) should only ever be called if you know that the player has been killed or arrested. Checking
IF NOT IS_PLAYER_PLAYING should be enough for this.

## Parameters
* **BOOL** ignore
