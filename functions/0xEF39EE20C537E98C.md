## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Call this at any time before or during a cutscene (but ideally at least 5 seconds before it ends) to indicate where
the camera will be after the cutscene is over. The streaming system will make sure that scene is in memory before the
cutscene switches back to normal gameplay.
