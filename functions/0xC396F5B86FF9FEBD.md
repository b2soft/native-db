# PED::SET_PED_LEG_IK_MODE

## Summary
Sets the allowed IK mode for a ped.

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** pedIndex
* **LEG_IK_MODE** legIkMode

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The default mode for non-player peds is LEG_IK_PARTIAL.

"IK" stands for "Inverse kinematics." I assume this has something to do with how the ped uses his legs to balance. In the scripts, the second parameter is always an int with a value of 2, 0, or sometimes 1
