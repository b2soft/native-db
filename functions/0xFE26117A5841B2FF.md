# GRAPHICS::GET_VEHICLE_CREW_EMBLEM_REQUEST_STATE

## Summary

CERS_NOT_ACTIVE			- means that an error has occured as no request is found for this vehicle
CERS_REQUESTING_BADGE	- means that the request is still in progress (still requesting the texture from the cloud)
CERS_APPLYING_DECAL		- means that the request is still in progress (still applying the decal)
CERS_SUCCEEDED			- means that the request has succeeded
