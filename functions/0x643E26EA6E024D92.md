## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Sets the rain value (between 0.0 and 1.0) - set to less than 0.0 to clear

With an `intensity` higher than `0.5f`, only the creation of puddles gets faster, rain and rain sound won't increase after that.
With an `intensity` of `0.0f` rain and rain sounds are disabled and there won't be any new puddles.
To use the rain intensity of the current weather, call this native with `-1f` as `intensity`.
