# AUDIO::STOP_PED_SPEAKING

## Summary
Stops a ped from saying any of their ambient dialogue

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** pedIndex
* **BOOL** shouldDisable

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This doesn't stop a piece of dialogue that has been triggered.
This stops the ability to force ambient dialogue if set to true - however setting it to false, then triggering a context, then setting it to true again will allow this.
Nb. This does not sync over the network, it will only affect peds locally. Use STOP_PED_SPEAKING_SYNCED if you need to affect peds on other machines too.
