# NETWORK::TEXTURE_DOWNLOAD_REQUEST

## Parameters
* **GAMER_HANDLE\*** gamerHandle: Gamer handle
* **STRING** cloudPath: Relative path to the file in the cloud, including the file name and extension
* **STRING** textureName: The name the user wants to give to the texture once it's downloaded; the texture dictionary containing this texture will have the same name
* **BOOL** useCacheWithoutCloudChecks = false:
Sets whether the request should avoid checking with the server if a locally cached version of the texture (if it exists) is up-to-date.
This flag should always be set to TRUE if the user knows there's no need to hit the server.

## Returns
* **INT**: a handle to use in the other texture download commands, can return NULL if the request failed.

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Requests to download a texture from member space. The texture will not be immediately available; the user needs to query its state
by calling TEXTURE_DOWNLOAD_HAS_FAILED, TEXTURE_DOWNLOAD_GET_NAME or GET_STATUS_OF_TEXTURE_DOWNLOAD
