# CAM::SET_CAM_DOF_STRENGTH

## Parameters
* **CAMERA_INDEX** cameraIndex
* **FLOAT** strength

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Set the 'strength' of the camera's depth of field effect (0.0 to 1.0.) More info.
Note that this command nulls the effect of any previous call to SET_CAM_DOF_PLANES, as the out-of-focus DOF planes will henceforth be derived based upon the DOF strength.
