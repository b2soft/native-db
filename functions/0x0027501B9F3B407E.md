# PATHFIND::SET_ROADS_BACK_TO_ORIGINAL_IN_ANGLED_AREA

## Summary
Sets all vehicle nodes back to their original state. (as per the map data). This is to match turning them on in an angled area

## Parameters
* **FLOAT** vec1X
* **FLOAT** vec1Y
* **FLOAT** vec1Z
* **FLOAT** vec2X
* **FLOAT** vec2Y
* **FLOAT** vec2Z
* **FLOAT** areaWidth
* **BOOL** network = true

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
It is not cool to call a SET_ROADS_IN_AREA(true)  to undo a SET_ROADS_IN_AREA(false) because the nodes that were originally off would now be on.

See IS_POINT_IN_ANGLED_AREA for the definition of an angled area.
