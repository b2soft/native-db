# PLAYER::GET_ARE_CAMERA_CONTROLS_DISABLED

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Returns true if the main player's camera controls are disabled. This returns true if the there is no main player info.

Returns true when the player is not able to control the cam i.e. when running a benchmark test, switching the player or viewing a cutscene.

Note: I am not 100% sure if the native actually checks if the cam control is disabled but it seems promising.
