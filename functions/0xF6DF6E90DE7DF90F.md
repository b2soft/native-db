# OBJECT::SET_OBJECT_PHYSICS_PARAMS

## Summary
Set physics parameters on this instance of an object.

## Parameters
* **OBJECT_INDEX** objectIndex
* **FLOAT** mass: Object mass (rotational inertia is calculated from new mass and volume)
* **FLOAT** gravityFactor: The gravity affecting this object can be modified (default is 1.0) TranslationalDamping: x = x = constant friction (doesn't depend on speed) y = y*V = speed dependent friction (multiplied by speed) z = z*V^2 = aerodynamic drag (multiplied by speed squared) RotationalDamping x = x = constant friction (doesn't depend on speed) y = y*V = speed dependent friction (multiplied by speed) z = z*V^2 = aerodynamic drag (multiplied by speed squared)
* **FLOAT** translationalDampingX
* **FLOAT** translationalDampingY
* **FLOAT** translationalDampingZ
* **FLOAT** rotationalDampingX
* **FLOAT** rotationalDampingY
* **FLOAT** rotationalDampingZ
* **FLOAT** collisionMargin = -1:
 Set to thinnist part of object.
Default is 10cm
* **FLOAT** maxAngularSpeed = -1:
 Increase for objects which are likely to spin fast, e.g.
small spheres.
Default is 2*PI
* **FLOAT** buoyancyFactor = -1:  Allow scaling of an object's buoyancy in water.

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Any param set to -1.0 will be ignored, and will remain as defaults.
Specifying mass = -1.0 will reset the mass back to the object's default value

Adjust the physics parameters of a prop, or otherwise known as "object". This is useful for simulated gravity.

Other parameters seem to be unknown.

p2: seems to be weight and gravity related. Higher value makes the obj fall faster. Very sensitive?
p3: seems similar to p2
p4: makes obj fall slower the higher the value
p5: similar to p4
