# PATHFIND::DOES_NAVMESH_BLOCKING_OBJECT_EXIST

## Parameters
* **INT** objectId

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Queries whether a navmesh blocking object with the specfied index exists
This may be useful during mission shutdown, or S/F skips, where the mission-cleanup code automatically
removes all the objects which the script adds - but where the script itself may try to manually remove them.
Wrapping REMOVE_NAVMESH_BLOCKING_OBJECT with a call to DOES_NAVMESH_BLOCKING_OBJECT_EXIST, will ensure
there are no warnings about the script trying to remove an object which doesn't exist.
