# CAM::DISABLE_NEAR_CLIP_SCAN_THIS_UPDATE

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Disables the (PS3-specific) scanning near-clip for this update only. This prevents the final rendered near-clip distance from being increased automatically when the extended frustum in front of the camera is free of collision. Note that use of this command may result in increased z-fighting on PS3, as the scanning near-clip is designed to reduce this.
