## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Start a transition to a timecycle, either from "nothing" or from the currently active script modifier if there's one.
MAKE SURE TO CALL CLEAR_TIMECYCLE_MODIFIER when you're done. If this doesn't happen the game will from that point on use that filter.
