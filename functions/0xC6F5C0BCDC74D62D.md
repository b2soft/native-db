# TASK::GET_NAVMESH_ROUTE_DISTANCE_REMAINING

## Summary
Query how much distance is remaining on a ped's navmesh route

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** pedIndex
* **FLOAT\*** outDistanceRemaining
* **INT\*** outThisIsLastRouteSection

## Returns
* **NAVMESH_ROUTE_RESULT**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Peds navigate long distances using a series of smaller sub-routes.  Only one sub-route is ever stored in the navmesh task.
This script function queries that subroute to determine how much distance is left on it.  Therefore:
You can only really trust the results of this function if "bThisIsLastRouteSection" returns as TRUE
Otherwise there may be any number of further sub-route sections remaining, but not yet calcualted..  Be careful

Looks like the last parameter returns true if the path has been calculated, while the first returns the remaining distance to the end of the path.
Return value of native is the same as GET_NAVMESH_ROUTE_RESULT
Looks like the native returns an int for the path's state:
1 - ???
2 - ???
