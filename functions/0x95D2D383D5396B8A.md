## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Sets the ped drunk sounds.  Only works with PLAYER_PED_ID

====================================================

As mentioned above, this only sets the drunk sound to ped/player.

To give the Ped a drunk effect with drunk walking animation try using SET_PED_MOVEMENT_CLIPSET

Below is an example

if (!Function.Call<bool>(Hash.HAS_ANIM_SET_LOADED, "move_m@drunk@verydrunk"))
                {
                    Function.Call(Hash.REQUEST_ANIM_SET, "move_m@drunk@verydrunk");
                }
                Function.Call(Hash.SET_PED_MOVEMENT_CLIPSET, Ped.Handle, "move_m@drunk@verydrunk", 0x3E800000);



And to stop the effect use
RESET_PED_MOVEMENT_CLIPSET
