# PATHFIND::GET_NTH_CLOSEST_VEHICLE_NODE_WITH_HEADING

## Summary
WIill return if can the nth ( n = 1 being closest) closest vehicle node with a heading, to a coord.

## Parameters
* **FLOAT** coorsX
* **FLOAT** coorsY
* **FLOAT** coorsZ
* **INT** nodeNumber
* **VECTOR\*** outNearestNodeCoors
* **FLOAT\*** outHeading
* **INT\*** outNumLanes
* **NODE_FLAGS** nodeFlags = 1
* **FLOAT** zMeasureMult = 3:
How strongly should the difference in Z direction be weighted? 0.0 = ignored completely, 1.0 = the same as 2d distance.
Default is 3.0 since we tend to care about height differences more than 2d distance.
* **FLOAT** zTolerance = 0: How far apart to the Z coords have to be before zMeasureMult kicks in?

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Returns a heading which can be used to set a car facing in a reasonable direction when it is placed on the car node.
The command will return FALSE if no node could be found (probably due to the nodes not being streamed in).

Get the nth closest vehicle node and its heading.
