## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Set the distances of the four planes for the camera's depth of field effect (in m.) More info.
Note that this command nulls the effect of any previous call to SET_CAM_DOF_STRENGTH, as the four DOF planes are overwritten and the relationship between the out-of-focus planes and the DOF strength is broken.
