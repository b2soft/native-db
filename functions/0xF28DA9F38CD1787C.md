# GRAPHICS::START_PARTICLE_FX_LOOPED_ON_PED_BONE

## Summary
Start a looped particle effect on a ped bone with an offset position and orientation.

## Parameters
* **STRING** fxName: The name of the particle effect to be started
* **PED_INDEX** pedIndex: The index of the ped to attach this particle effect to VECTOR position - the offset position to play the particle effect at VECTOR rotation - the offset rotation of the particle effect
* **FLOAT** vecPositionX
* **FLOAT** vecPositionY
* **FLOAT** vecPositionZ
* **FLOAT** vecRotationX
* **FLOAT** vecRotationY
* **FLOAT** vecRotationZ
* **PED_BONETAG** boneTag: The bone tag to attach the particle effect to
* **FLOAT** scale = 1: Size scale of the effect (default size = 1.0) INT - the id of the created particle effect - this will be 0 if creation fails
* **BOOL** invertAxisX = false
* **BOOL** invertAxisY = false
* **BOOL** invertAxisZ = false

## Returns
* **PTFX_ID**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Triggers a named particle effect attached to a ped bone with an offset position and rotation.
This should only be used with infinitely looping particle effects.
The particle effect will then start playing and will need to be stopped by calling STOP_PTFX.
The returned id of the particle effect needs to be passed into any other function that needs to be called on it.
