# TASK::TASK_SHOOT_AT_ENTITY

## Summary
Gives a shoot at entity task.

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** pedIndex
* **ENTITY_INDEX** entityIndex
* **INT** time
* **FIRING_TYPE** firingType

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
If -1 is passed to Time the ped will never give up on the task.

//this part of the code is to determine at which entity the player is aiming, for example if you want to create a mod where you give orders to peds
Entity aimedentity;
Player player = PLAYER::PLAYER_ID();
PLAYER::_GET_AIMED_ENTITY(player, &aimedentity);

//bg is an array of peds
TASK::TASK_SHOOT_AT_ENTITY(bg[i], aimedentity, 5000, MISC::GET_HASH_KEY("FIRING_PATTERN_FULL_AUTO"));

in practical usage, getting the entity the player is aiming at and then task the peds to shoot at the entity, at a button press event would be better.
