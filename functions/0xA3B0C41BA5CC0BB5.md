## Summary
Stops a playing sound by its sound id.

## Parameters
* **INT** soundId

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
SoundId must be specified when triggering the sound effect and must be referred to when calling STOP_SOUND.
Calling STOP_SOUND on a sound that has finished playing will have no ill effects as long as the SoundId hasn't been released; attempting to stop an invalid SoundId will cause an assert.
