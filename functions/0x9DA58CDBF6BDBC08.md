# WEAPON::CREATE_AIR_DEFENCE_ANGLED_AREA

## Summary
Any bullets, projectiles or air vehicles that enter this angled area will be destroyed/exploded.
Weapon is used to trigger a shot/VFX aimed at the area intersection position of any bullets/projectiles to look like they're being shot down.
If no weapon hash passed in, angled area will not fire at vehicles, and bullets/projectiles will only be deleted.
Peds inside the angled area will enter the weapon blocked state when trying to aim.
MAX_AIR_DEFENCE_ZONES = 10, speak to Blair Trusler/David Hynd if this needs increasing.
