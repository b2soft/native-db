## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Plays back a sound with the name SoundName. Optionally can specify a sound set which contains the named sound.
If the sound is to be manipulated - i.e. stopped - then a SoundId should be acquired using GET_SOUND_ID(), otherwise use -1.
If this is used to play a sound for which no Pan or Speakermask is set by the sound designer, then the sound will play from the map's origin -
therefore this should only be used to play frontend sounds like menu bleeps or other artificially panned effects.
