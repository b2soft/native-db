# PATHFIND::GET_NTH_CLOSEST_VEHICLE_NODE_ID

## Summary
Will return if can the nth ( n = 1 being closest) closest vehicle node (by index), to a coord

## Parameters
* **FLOAT** coorsX
* **FLOAT** coorsY
* **FLOAT** coorsZ
* **INT** nodeNumber
* **NODE_FLAGS** nodeFlags = 1
* **FLOAT** zMeasureMult = 3:
How strongly should the difference in Z direction be weighted? 0.0 = ignored completely, 1.0 = the same as 2d distance.
Default is 3.0 since we tend to care about height differences more than 2d distance.
* **FLOAT** zTolerance = 0: How far apart to the Z coords have to be before zMeasureMult kicks in?

## Returns
* **VEHICLE_NODE_ID**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
As GET_NTH_CLOSEST_VEHICLE_NODE... but returns a node index. This node index MUST be used within this frame as it's validity is not guaranteed outside.

Returns the id.
