<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Make sure to call this from the correct thread if you're using multiple threads because all other threads except the one which is calling SET_GAME_PAUSED will be paused which means you will lose control and the game remains in paused mode until you exit GTA5.exe
