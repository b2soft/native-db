# NETWORK::TRIGGER_FILE_CRC_HACKER_CHECK

## Parameters
* **PLAYER_INDEX** receiver
* **STRING** fileToHash

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Same exact behaviour as TRIGGER_PLAYER_CRC_HACKER_CHECK.
This is a wrapper to perform whole file hash checks passing filename string as a param.
Code will internally decide if this can be handled as a CRC_DATA_FILE_CONTENTS or a CRC_GENERIC_FILE_CONTENTS check, and process the string accordingly.
