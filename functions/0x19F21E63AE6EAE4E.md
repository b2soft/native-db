# AUDIO::SET_USER_RADIO_CONTROL_ENABLED

## Summary
Enables/disables user control over radio - retuning etc

## Parameters
* **BOOL** enabled:
When called with enabled=false user control over radio retunes will be inhibited.
 Call with enabled=true to re-enable.

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Scripts can call this safely without worrying about conflicts with other scripts - calls can be
nested, and if any system wants radio control disabled then it will be.  This does mean that scripts
must ensure they only call this function when their state changes, and not every frame
