## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Creates an incident and returns an index, requests a set number of units

As for the 'police' incident, it will call police cars to you, but unlike PedsInCavalcades & Merryweather they won't start shooting at you unless you shoot first or shoot at them. The top 2 however seem to cancel theirselves if there is noone dead around you or a fire. I only figured them out as I found out the 3rd param is definately the amountOfPeople and they called incident 3 in scripts with 4 people (which the firetruck has) and incident 5 with 2 people (which the ambulence has). The 4 param I cant say is radius, but for the pedsInCavalcades and Merryweather R* uses 0.0f and for the top 3 (Emergency Services) they use 3.0f. 

Side Note: It seems calling the pedsInCavalcades or Merryweather then removing it seems to break you from calling the EmergencyEvents and I also believe pedsInCavalcades. (The V cavalcades of course not IV).

Side Note 2: I say it breaks as if you call this proper,
if(CREATE_INCIDENT) etc it will return false if you do as I said above.
