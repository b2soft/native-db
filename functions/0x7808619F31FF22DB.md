# NETWORK::NETWORK_IS_CONNETED_TO_NP_PRESENCE

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Returns TRUE if the player is connected to either PSN or RPresence
When FALSE, we can safely assume an internet connection has been lost. Use this when handling
connection change events to determine if the user has gone offline due to a sign out or net connection loss.

This function is hard-coded to always return 1.
