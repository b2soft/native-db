# HUD::SET_GPS_FLAGS

## Parameters
* **GPS_FLAGS** flags
* **FLOAT** blippedRouteDisplayDistance = 0

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Only the script that originally called SET_GPS_FLAGS can set them again. Another script cannot set the flags, until the first script that called it has called CLEAR_GPS_FLAGS.

Doesn't seem like the flags are actually read by the game at all.
