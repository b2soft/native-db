## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
If there is no ped in the seat, and the game considers the vehicle as ambient population, this will create a random occupant ped in the seat, which may be cleaned up by the game fairly soon if not marked as script-owned mission entity.

Seat indexes:
-1 = Driver
0 = Front Right Passenger
1 = Back Left Passenger
2 = Back Right Passenger
3 = Further Back Left Passenger (vehicles > 4 seats)
4 = Further Back Right Passenger (vehicles > 4 seats)
etc.

If p2 is true it uses a different GetOccupant function.
