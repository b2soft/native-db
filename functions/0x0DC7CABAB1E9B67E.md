# ENTITY::SET_ENTITY_LOAD_COLLISION_FLAG

## Summary
Sets the collision around the entity to load.

## Parameters
* **ENTITY_INDEX** entityIndex
* **BOOL** loadCollisionFlag
* **BOOL** doDeadCheck = true

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Loads collision grid for an entity spawned outside of a player's loaded area. This allows peds to execute tasks rather than sit dormant because of a lack of a physics grid.
Certainly not the main usage of this native but when set to true for a Vehicle, it will prevent the vehicle to explode if it is spawned far away from the player.
