## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This command takes the waves into account so the result may be different depending on the exact frame of calling.

This function set height to the value of z-axis of the water surface.

This function works with sea and lake. However it does not work with shallow rivers (e.g. raton canyon will return -100000.0f)

note: seems to return true when you are in water
