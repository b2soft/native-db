## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The shapetest request is destroyed by this call if SHAPETEST_STATUS_RESULTS_READY is returned.
If this is not called every frame then the request will be destroyed

Returns the result of a shape test: 0 if the handle is invalid, 1 if the shape test is still pending, or 2 if the shape test has completed, and the handle should be invalidated.

When used with an asynchronous shape test, this native should be looped until returning 0 or 2, after which the handle is invalidated.
