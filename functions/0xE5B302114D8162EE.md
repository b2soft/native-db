## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Used to update a drive by task target (instead of constantly clearing and creating a new task)

For p1 & p2 (Ped, Vehicle). I could be wrong, as the only time this native is called in scripts is once and both are 0, but I assume this native will work like SET_MOUNTED_WEAPON_TARGET in which has the same exact amount of parameters and the 1st and last 3 parameters are right and the same for both natives.
