# HUD::START_GPS_MULTI_ROUTE

## Parameters
* **HUD_COLOURS** colour
* **BOOL** trackPlayer = true
* **BOOL** onFoot = false

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Initialises the GPS to calculate a route using the road nodes & passing through multiple waypoints, one after the other
The route between each given waypoint will be the shortest available using roads

Starts a new GPS multi-route, allowing you to create custom GPS paths.
GPS functions like the waypoint, except it can contain multiple points it's forced to go through.
Once the player has passed a point, the GPS will no longer force its path through it.

Works independently from the player-placed waypoint and blip routes.
