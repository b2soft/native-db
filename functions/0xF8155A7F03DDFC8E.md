# STREAMING::SET_SRL_FORCE_PRESTREAM

## Summary
Enable or disable forced prestreaming for cutscenes. If enabled, the SRL will always preload map data for the first
frame of a cutscene, even if it is far away. BE CAREFUL when using this function. Only use it when you are CERTAIN
that the current camera position and the first frame of the cutscene can't get too far away, and when you're certain
that the two scenes are not particularly rich in entities. Otherwise, you will crash with a pool overflow.

## Parameters
* **SRL_PRESTREAM_MODE** forcePrestream
