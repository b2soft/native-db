## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Sets the vehicle to ignore calls to set the wheel compression (ie. from SET_VEHICLE_ON_GROUND_PROPERLY)
to allow blending back into the game from a cutscene task without the wheels popping. Use this command only
if you're sure the cutscene places the vehicle/wheels in a state that is okay to enter the game with
