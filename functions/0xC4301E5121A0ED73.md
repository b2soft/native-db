# MISC::SET_MISSION_FLAG

## Summary
Sets the script as a mission script

## Parameters
* **BOOL** missionFlagValue

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
FlagOnAMission should be a BOOL. Every time the player starts a mission, you must remember to set this variable to TRUE.
If the flag is TRUE, it will be set back to FALSE when you call MISSION_HAS_FINISHED.
Use this instead of DECLARE_MISSION_FLAG

If true, the player can't save the game. 


If the parameter is true, sets the mission flag to true, if the parameter is false, the function does nothing at all.

^ also, if the mission flag is already set, the function does nothing at all
