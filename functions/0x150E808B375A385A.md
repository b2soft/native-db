## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Sometimes (e.g. when following an NPC-driven vehicle ahead of you) it is necessary to force particular barriers to become real objects
so the vehicle you are following smashes through them properly rather than passing through without collision.
Creates a persistent force-to-object effect on map
