* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Because teh metadata and the crew info for crews aren't always complete, just because
this function returns true, it doesn't mean that the data you're asking for it there.
It may not be included in the crew info.  Rely on the return values of the request functions
to be sure.
