# GRAPHICS::START_PARTICLE_FX_LOOPED_AT_COORD

## Summary
Start a looped particle effect at a world position and orientation

## Parameters
* **STRING** fxName: The name of the particle effect to be started VECTOR position - the world position to play the particle effect at VECTOR rotation - the offset rotation of the particle effect
* **FLOAT** vecPositionX
* **FLOAT** vecPositionY
* **FLOAT** vecPositionZ
* **FLOAT** vecRotationX
* **FLOAT** vecRotationY
* **FLOAT** vecRotationZ
* **FLOAT** scale = 1: Size scale of the effect (default size = 1.0) INT - the id of the created particle effect - this will be 0 if creation fails
* **BOOL** invertAxisX = false
* **BOOL** invertAxisY = false
* **BOOL** invertAxisZ = false
* **BOOL** localOnly = false

## Returns
* **PTFX_ID**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Triggers a named particle effect at an world position.
This should only be used with infinitely looping particle effects.
The particle effect will then start playing and will need to be stopped by calling STOP_PTFX.
The returned id of the particle effect needs to be passed into any other function that needs to be called on it.
