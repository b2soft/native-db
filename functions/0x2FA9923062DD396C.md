## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This command is similar to the basic ADD_STUCK_CAR_CHECK except that the game will attempt to warp the car as soon as it becomes stuck.
The three flags are used to control whether the car is warped if it has become stuck, as soon as it is upside-down or as soon as it is in water.
