# GRAPHICS::START_PARTICLE_FX_NON_LOOPED_AT_COORD

## Summary
Trigger a set piece (non looped) particle effect at a world position and orientation.

## Parameters
* **STRING** fxName: The name of the particle effect to be triggered VECTOR position - the world position to play the particle effect at VECTOR rotation - the offset rotation of the particle effect
* **FLOAT** vecPositionX
* **FLOAT** vecPositionY
* **FLOAT** vecPositionZ
* **FLOAT** vecRotationX
* **FLOAT** vecRotationY
* **FLOAT** vecRotationZ
* **FLOAT** scale = 1: Size scale of the effect (default size = 1.0) BOOL - whether or not the particle effect has been created ok
* **BOOL** invertAxisX = false
* **BOOL** invertAxisY = false
* **BOOL** invertAxisZ = false

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Triggers a named particle effect at a world position.
This should only be used with non-looped particle effects.
The particle effect will then play and tidy itself up when finished.
There is no access to the particle effect once it has been triggered.

C#

Function.Call<int>(Hash.START_PARTICLE_FX_NON_LOOPED_AT_COORD, = you are calling this function.

char *effectname = This is an in-game effect name, for e.g. "scr_fbi4_trucks_crash" is used to give the effects when truck crashes etc

float x, y, z pos = this one is Simple, you just have to declare, where do you want this effect to take place at, so declare the ordinates

float xrot, yrot, zrot = Again simple? just mention the value in case if you want the effect to rotate.

float scale = is declare the scale of the effect, this may vary as per the effects for e.g 1.0f

bool xaxis, yaxis, zaxis = To bool the axis values.

example:
Function.Call<int>(Hash.START_PARTICLE_FX_NON_LOOPED_AT_COORD, "scr_fbi4_trucks_crash", GTA.Game.Player.Character.Position.X, GTA.Game.Player.Character.Position.Y, GTA.Game.Player.Character.Position.Z + 4f, 0, 0, 0, 5.5f, 0, 0, 0);
