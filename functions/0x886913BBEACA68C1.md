## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Check the status of STAT_SAVE_MIGRATION_STATUS_START(). We need to call this 1st to make sure the game is not returning
SMS_SKIP_ACCOUNT_ALREADY_USED which means we dont need to call STAT_SAVE_MIGRATION_STATUS_START( ). Also the tunable
check to skip STAT_SAVE_MIGRATION_STATUS_START( ) must be added at this point.
You must have this before using this command - ARE_PROFILE_SETTINGS_VALID( ) and NETWORK_IS_SIGNED_ONLINE()
