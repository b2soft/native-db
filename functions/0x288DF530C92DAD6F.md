<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The steer bias value gets added to the players control input.
The bias is in the range -1.0f (hard right) to 1.0f (hard left). Ie If you set the bias to 0.1 the ped will pull to the left a little bit.
By modifying the value from frame to frame you can emulate buggered controls or somebody fighting over control of the ped.
