## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Same exact behaviour as TRIGGER_PLAYER_CRC_HACKER_CHECK.
This is a wrapper to perform just CRC_TUNING_SYSTEM script checks passing strings as a param (nicer input).
Code will internally pack them into an INT subsystem and pass it to a TRIGGER_PLAYER_CRC_HACKER_CHECK call.
Example input: group "Player Targetting" and instance "CPlayerPedTargeting"
