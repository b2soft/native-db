May return the vehicle health on a scale of 0.0 - 100.0 (needs to be confirmed)

example:

v_F = ENTITY::GET_ENTITY_MODEL(v_3);
if (((v_F == ${tanker}) || (v_F == ${armytanker})) || (v_F == ${tanker2})) {
    if (VEHICLE::GET_VEHICLE_HEALTH_PERCENTAGE(v_3) <= 1.0) {
        NETWORK::NETWORK_EXPLODE_VEHICLE(v_3, 1, 1, -1);
    }
}
