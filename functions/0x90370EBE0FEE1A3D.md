# PED::CREATE_GROUP

## Summary
Creates a group

## Parameters
* **DEFAULT_TASK_ALLOCATOR** defaultTaskType

## Returns
* **GROUP_INDEX**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Every frame, the code automatically removes any group which doesn't have any leader/members.
This means that you have to set a group leader in the same frame as the group is created, as otherwise you'll get an assert about the group ID being out of range (i.e. the group doesn't exist)
The Player already has a group so a group doens't need to be created for them.

Creates a new ped group.
Groups can contain up to 8 peds.

The parameter is unused.

Returns a handle to the created group, or 0 if a group couldn't be created.
