# BRAIN::REGISTER_WORLD_POINT_SCRIPT_BRAIN

## Summary
Registers a point in a world script point.

## Parameters
* **STRING** scriptName
* **FLOAT** activationRange
* **INT** setToWhichThisBrainBelongs:
Scripts can define one or more sets to which this brain belongs.
The sets should have a value that is a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...)

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This command gives a label to a brain script. The label is used by the artist when placing a 2d effect to launch the brain script.
This structure currently contains up to 3 sets of coordinates. It always has at least one coord which gives the world position around which the brain is centred.
For simplicity BrainLabel has been removed so that the name the artits give the 2deffect needs to match the filename of the script.
