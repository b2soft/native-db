## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Command to check if the direct access entry point for a seat is clear (ped can enter/exit). This is quite expensive,
So don't call it too often!

Check if a vehicle seat is accessible. If you park your vehicle near a wall and the ped cannot enter/exit this side, the return value toggles from true (not blocked) to false (blocked).

seatIndex  = -1 being the driver seat.
Use GET_VEHICLE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_PASSENGERS(vehicle) - 1 for last seat index.
side = only relevant for bikes/motorcycles to check if the left (false)/right (true) side is blocked.
onEnter = check if you can enter (true) or exit (false) a vehicle.
