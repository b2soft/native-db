# REPLAY::SET_REPLAY_SYSTEM_PAUSED_FOR_SAVE

## Summary
After REPLAY_SYSTEM_HAS_REQUESTED_A_SCRIPT_CLEANUP() returns TRUE for the first time, the replay code gives the scripts a few seconds to clean up before it clears the world.
To store Director Mode settings, the scripts may need to trigger an autosave.
Call SET_REPLAY_SYSTEM_PAUSED_FOR_SAVE(TRUE) once before triggering the autosave to prevent the replay code from timing out in the middle of the autosave.
Be sure to call SET_REPLAY_SYSTEM_PAUSED_FOR_SAVE(FALSE) after the autosave has finished.

## Parameters
* **BOOL** paused
