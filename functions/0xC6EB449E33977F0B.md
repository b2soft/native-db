# GRAPHICS::START_PARTICLE_FX_LOOPED_ON_ENTITY_BONE

## Summary
Start a looped particle effect on an entity with an offset position and orientation

## Parameters
* **STRING** fxName: The name of the particle effect to be started
* **ENTITY_INDEX** entityIndex: The index of the entity to attach this particle effect to VECTOR position - the offset position to play the particle effect at VECTOR rotation - the offset rotation of the particle effect
* **FLOAT** vecPositionX
* **FLOAT** vecPositionY
* **FLOAT** vecPositionZ
* **FLOAT** vecRotationX
* **FLOAT** vecRotationY
* **FLOAT** vecRotationZ
* **INT** boneIndex = -1: The bone index to attach the particle effect to (use GET_ENTITY_BONE_INDEX_BY_NAME to get the index)
* **FLOAT** scale = 1: Size scale of the effect (default size = 1.0) INT - the id of the created particle effect - this will be 0 if creation fails
* **BOOL** invertAxisX = false
* **BOOL** invertAxisY = false
* **BOOL** invertAxisZ = false

## Returns
* **PTFX_ID**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Triggers a named particle effect attached to an entity bone with an offset position.
This should only be used with infinitely looping particle effects.
The particle effect will then start playing and will need to be stopped by calling STOP_PTFX.
The returned id of the particle effect needs to be passed into any other function that needs to be called on it.+
