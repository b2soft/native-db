This command will probably only be of use in cut scenes. For a slow motion effect, try setting NewTimeScale to 0.5.
Remember to set the Time Scale back to this once you have finished with the special effect.

Maximum value is 1.
At a value of 0 the game will still run at a minimum time scale.

Slow Motion 1: 0.6
Slow Motion 2: 0.4
Slow Motion 3: 0.2
