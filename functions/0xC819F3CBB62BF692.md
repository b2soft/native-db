# CAM::STOP_RENDERING_SCRIPT_CAMS_USING_CATCH_UP

## Summary
Tells the game that the script wants to disable rendering of scripted cameras and force gameplay camera to blend from scripted camera to gameplay camera

## Parameters
* **BOOL** shouldApplyAcrossAllThreads = false:
If true, a request to stop rendering will be enforced irrespective of whether other script threads expect rendering to be active.
Note that this can result in conflicts between concurrent script threads, so this must be used with caution.
* **FLOAT** distanceToBlend = 0: Overrides the distance over which the catch up blend occurs, if zero is specified, default blend distance will be used.
* **CAM_SPLINE_SMOOTHING_FLAGS** blendType = 3
* **RENDERING_OPTION_FLAGS** renderingOptions = 0

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The script must have created a camera that can be rendered. Note that rendering is typically not stopped if another script thread still expects it to be active (see bShouldApplyAcrossAllThreads.)

This native makes the gameplay camera zoom into first person/third person with a special effect.
