# PATHFIND::GET_CLOSEST_MAJOR_VEHICLE_NODE

## Summary
WIill return if can the closest vehicle node even if switched off, to a coord

## Parameters
* **FLOAT** coorsX
* **FLOAT** coorsY
* **FLOAT** coorsZ
* **VECTOR\*** outNearestNodeCoors
* **FLOAT** zMeasureMult = 3:
How strongly should the difference in Z direction be weighted? 0.0 = ignored completely, 1.0 = the same as 2d distance.
Default is 3.0 since we tend to care about height differences more than 2d distance.
* **FLOAT** zTolerance = 0: How far apart to the Z coords have to be before zMeasureMult kicks in?

## Returns
* **BOOL**
