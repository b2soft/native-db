## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Prevents the first entity from colliding with the second entity

Calling this function disables collision between two entities.
The importance of the order for entity1 and entity2 is unclear.
The third parameter, `thisFrame`, decides whether the collision is to be disabled until it is turned back on, or if it's just this frame.
