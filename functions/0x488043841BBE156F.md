## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Displays "blazer_wheels_up" and "blazer_wheels_down" "weapon" icons when switching between jetski and quadbike modes. Works only on vehicles using "VEHICLE_TYPE_AMPHIBIOUS_QUADBIKE" vehicle type. Needs to be called every time prior to switching modes, otherwise the icon will only appear when switching modes once.
