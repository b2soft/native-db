## Parameters
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** vehicleIndex

## Returns
* **INT**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Gets the current countermeasure ammo count for a script vehicle.
Unlike restricted vehicle ammo (which is code fired), this is script-fired and manually decremented, and only stored in vehicle code for network sync purposes.

Similar to `GET_VEHICLE_BOMB_AMMO`, this gets the amount of countermeasures that are present on this vehicle.
Use SET_VEHICLE_COUNTERMEASURE_AMMO to set the current amount.
