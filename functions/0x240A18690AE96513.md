# PATHFIND::GET_CLOSEST_VEHICLE_NODE

## Summary
WIill return if can the closest vehicle node to a coord.

## Parameters
* **FLOAT** coorsX
* **FLOAT** coorsY
* **FLOAT** coorsZ
* **VECTOR\*** outNearestNodeCoors
* **NODE_FLAGS** nodeFlags = 1
* **FLOAT** zMeasureMult = 3:
How strongly should the difference in Z direction be weighted? 0.0 = ignored completely, 1.0 = the same as 2d distance.
Default is 3.0 since we tend to care about height differences more than 2d distance.
* **FLOAT** zTolerance = 0: How far apart to the Z coords have to be before zMeasureMult kicks in?

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The commands will return FALSE if no node could be found (probably due to the nodes not being streamed in).
