## Notes
Struct for ending missions:
1. Club work
2. Club challenges
3. Member challenges
4. Clubhouse missions
5. Business missions m_missionTypeId - Make sure you set the values 1 to 5, see above.
m_bossId1 and m_bossId2 - this is like in contraband missions.
isBoss - this is set code side.
Set -1 for BLANK values.
